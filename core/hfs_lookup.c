/*	
 * FROM FREEBSD 3.1
 * Convert a component of a pathname into a pointer to a locked cnode.
 * This is a very central and rather complicated routine.
 * If the file system is not maintained in a strict tree hierarchy,
 * this can result in a deadlock situation (see comments in code below).
 *
 * The cnp->cn_nameiop argument is LOOKUP, CREATE, RENAME, or DELETE depending
 * on whether the name is to be looked up, created, renamed, or deleted.
 * When CREATE, RENAME, or DELETE is specified, information usable in
 * creating, renaming, or deleting a directory entry may be calculated.
 * Notice that these are the only operations that can affect the directory of the target.
 *
 * LOCKPARENT and WANTPARENT actually refer to the parent of the last item,
 * so if ISLASTCN is not set, they should be ignored. Also they are mutually exclusive, or
 * WANTPARENT really implies DONTLOCKPARENT. Either of them set means that the calling
 * routine wants to access the parent of the target, locked or unlocked.
 *
 * Keeping the parent locked as long as possible protects from other processes
 * looking up the same item, so it has to be locked until the cnode is totally finished
 *
 * hfs_cache_lookup() performs the following for us:
 *	check that it is a directory
 *	check accessibility of directory
 *	check for modification attempts on read-only mounts
 *	if name found in cache
 *		if at end of path and deleting or creating
 *		drop it
 *		 else
 *		return name.
 *	return hfs_lookup()
 *
 * Overall outline of hfs_lookup:
 *
 *	handle simple cases of . and ..
 *	search for name in directory, to found or notfound
 * notfound:
 *	if creating, return locked directory, leaving info on available slots
 *	else return error
 * found:
 *	if at end of path and deleting, return information to allow delete
 *	if at end of path and rewriting (RENAME and LOCKPARENT), lock target
 *	  cnode and return info to allow rewrite
 *	if not at end, add name to cache; if at end and neither creating
 *	  nor deleting, add name to cache
