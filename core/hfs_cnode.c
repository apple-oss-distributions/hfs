 * hfs_cnode_teardown
 *
 * This is an internal function that is invoked from both hfs_vnop_inactive
 * and hfs_vnop_reclaim.  As VNOP_INACTIVE is not necessarily called from vnodes
 * being recycled and reclaimed, it is important that we do any post-processing
 * necessary for the cnode in both places.  Important tasks include things such as
 * releasing the blocks from an open-unlinked file when all references to it have dropped,
 * and handling resource forks separately from data forks.
 *
 * Note that we take only the vnode as an argument here (rather than the cnode).
 * Recall that each cnode supports two forks (rsrc/data), and we can always get the right
 * cnode from either of the vnodes, but the reverse is not true -- we can't determine which
 * vnode we need to reclaim if only the cnode is supplied. 
 *
 * This function is idempotent and safe to call from both hfs_vnop_inactive and hfs_vnop_reclaim
 * if both are invoked right after the other.  In the second call, most of this function's if()
 * conditions will fail, since they apply generally to cnodes still marked with C_DELETED.  
 * As a quick check to see if this function is necessary, determine if the cnode is already
 * marked C_NOEXISTS.  If it is, then it is safe to skip this function.  The only tasks that 
 * remain for cnodes marked in such a fashion is to teardown their fork references and 
 * release all directory hints and hardlink origins.  However, both of those are done 
 * in hfs_vnop_reclaim.  hfs_update, by definition, is not necessary if the cnode's catalog
 * entry is no longer there.  
 *
 * 'reclaim' argument specifies whether or not we were called from hfs_vnop_reclaim.  If we are
 * invoked from hfs_vnop_reclaim, we can not call functions that cluster_push since the UBC info 
 * is totally gone by that point.
 *
 * Assumes that both truncate and cnode locks for 'cp' are held.

 * hfs_getnewvnode - get new default vnode
 *
 * The vnode is returned with an iocount and the cnode locked.  
 * The cnode of the parent vnode 'dvp' may or may not be locked, depending on 
 * the circumstances.   The cnode in question (if acquiring the resource fork),
 * may also already be locked at the time we enter this function.
 *
 * Note that there are both input and output flag arguments to this function.  
 * If one of the input flags (specifically, GNV_USE_VP), is set, then 
 * hfs_getnewvnode will use the parameter *vpp, which is traditionally only 
 * an output parameter, as both an input and output parameter.  It will use 
 * the vnode provided in the output, and pass it to vnode_create with the 
 * proper flavor so that a new vnode is _NOT_ created on our behalf when 
 * we dispatch to VFS.  This may be important in various HFS vnode creation
 * routines, such a create or get-resource-fork, because we risk deadlock if
 * jetsam is involved.
 *
 * Deadlock potential exists if jetsam is synchronously invoked while we are waiting
 * for a vnode to be recycled in order to give it the identity we want.  If jetsam
 * happens to target a process for termination that is blocked in-kernel, waiting to 
 * acquire the cnode lock on our parent 'dvp', while our current thread has it locked, 
 * neither side will make forward progress and the watchdog timer will eventually fire. 
 * To prevent this, a caller of hfs_getnewvnode may choose to proactively force 
 * any necessary vnode reclamation/recycling while it is not holding any locks and 
 * thus not prone to deadlock.  If this is the case, GNV_USE_VP will be set and
 * the parameter will be used as described above. 
 *
 *  !!! <NOTE> !!!!
 * In circumstances when GNV_USE_VP is set, this function _MUST_ clean up and either consume
 * or dispose of the provided vnode. We funnel all errors to a single return value so that
 * if provided_vp is still non-NULL, then we will dispose of the vnode. This will occur in
 * all error cases of this function --  anywhere we zero/NULL out the *vpp parameter. It may 
 * also occur if the current thread raced with another to create the same vnode, and we 
 * find the entry already present in the cnode hash.

 *
 * Note that finderinfo is manipulated in hfs_vnop_setxattr and care
 * is and should be taken to ignore user attempts to set the part of
 * the finderinfo that records the generation counter.
 *
 * Any change to the generation counter *must* not be visible before
 * the change that caused it (for obvious reasons), and given the
 * limitations of our current architecture, the change to the
 * generation counter may occur some time afterwards (particularly in
 * the case where a file is mapped writable---more on that below).
 *
 * We make no guarantees about the consistency of a file.  In other
 * words, a reader that is operating concurrently with a writer might
 * see some, but not all of writer's changes, and the generation
 * counter will *not* necessarily tell you this has happened.  To
 * enforce consistency, clients must make their own arrangements
 * e.g. use file locking.
 *
 * We treat files that are mapped writable as a special case: when
 * that happens, clients requesting the generation count will be told
 * it has a generation count of zero and they use that knowledge as a
 * hint that the file is changing and it therefore might be prudent to
 * wait until it is no longer mapped writable.  Clients should *not*
 * rely on this behaviour however; we might decide that it's better
 * for us to publish the fact that a file is mapped writable via
 * alternate means and return the generation counter when it is mapped
 * writable as it still has some, albeit limited, use.  We reserve the
 * right to make this change.
 *
 * Lastly, it's important to realise that because data and metadata
 * take different paths through the system, it's possible upon crash
 * or sudden power loss and after a restart, that a change may be
 * visible to the rest of the system without a corresponding change to
 * the generation counter.  The reverse may also be true, but for all
 * practical applications this shouldn't be an issue.
