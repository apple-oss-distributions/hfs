/*
 * hfs_fsinfo_data is generic data structure to aggregate information like sizes
 * or counts in buckets of power of 2.  Each bucket represents a range of values
 * that is determined based on its index in the array.  Specifically, buckets[i]
 * represents values that are greater than or equal to 2^(i-1) and less than 2^i,
 * except the last bucket which represents range greater than or equal to 2^(i-1)
 *
 * The current maximum number of buckets is 41, so we can represent range from
 * 0 up to 1TB in increments of power of 2, and then a catch-all bucket of
 * anything that is greater than or equal to 1TB.
 *
 * For example,
 * bucket[0]  -> greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1
 * bucket[1]  -> greater than or equal to 1 and less than 2
 * bucket[10] -> greater than or equal to 2^(10-1) = 512 and less than 2^10 = 1024
 * bucket[20] -> greater than or equal to 2^(20-1) = 512KB and less than 2^20 = 1MB
 * bucket[41] -> greater than or equal to 2^(41-1) = 1TB
 *
 * Note that fsctls that populate this data structure can take long time to
 * execute as this operation can be I/O intensive (traversing btrees) and compute
 * intensive.
 *
 * WARNING: Any changes to this structure should also update version number to
 * ensure that the clients and kernel are reading/writing correctly.
