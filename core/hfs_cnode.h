/*
 * -- The Truncate Lock --
 *
 * The truncate lock is used for a few purposes (more than its name
 * might suggest).  The first thing to note is that the cnode lock
 * cannot be held whilst issuing any I/O other than metadata changes,
 * so the truncate lock, in either shared or exclusive form, must
 * usually be held in these cases.  This includes calls to ubc_setsize
 * where the new size is less than the current size known to the VM
 * subsystem (for two reasons: a) because reaping pages can block
 * (e.g. on pages that are busy or being cleaned); b) reaping pages
 * might require page-in for tasks that have that region mapped
 * privately).  The same applies to other calls into the VM subsystem.
 *
 * Here are some (but not necessarily all) cases that the truncate
 * lock protects for:
 *
 *  + When reading and writing a file, we hold the truncate lock
 *    shared to ensure that the underlying blocks cannot be deleted
 *    and on systems that use content protection, this also ensures
 *    the keys remain valid (which might be being used by the
 *    underlying layers).
 *
 *  + We need to protect against the following sequence of events:
 *
 *      A file is initially size X.  A thread issues an append to that
 *      file.  Another thread truncates the file and then extends it
 *      to a a new size Y.  Now the append can be applied at offset X
 *      and then the data is lost when the file is truncated; or it
 *      could be applied after the truncate, i.e. at offset 0; or it
 *      can be applied at offset Y.  What we *cannot* do is apply the
 *      append at offset X and for the data to be visible at the end.
 *      (Note that we are free to choose when we apply the append
 *      operation.)
 *
 *    To solve this, we keep things simple and take the truncate lock
 *    exclusively in order to sequence the append with other size
 *    changes.  Therefore any size change must take the truncate lock
 *    exclusively.
 *
 *    (N.B. we could do better and allow readers to run concurrently
 *    during the append and other size changes.)
 *
 * So here are the rules:
 *
 *  + If you plan to change ff_size, you must take the truncate lock
 *    exclusively, *but* be careful what I/O you do whilst you have
 *    the truncate lock exclusively and try and avoid it if you can:
 *    if the VM subsystem tries to do something with some pages on a
 *    different thread and you try and do some I/O with those same
 *    pages, we will deadlock.  (See #16620278.)
 *
 *  + If you do anything that requires blocks to not be deleted or
 *    encryption keys to remain valid, you must take the truncate lock
 *    shared.
 *
 *  + And it follows therefore, that if you want to delete blocks or
 *    delete keys, you must take the truncate lock exclusively.  Note 
 *    that for asynchronous writes, the truncate lock will be dropped 
 *    after issuing I/O but before the I/O has completed which means
 *    that before manipulating keys, you *must* issue
 *    vnode_wait_for_writes in addition to holding the truncate lock.
 *
 * N.B. ff_size is actually protected by the cnode lock and so you
 * must hold the cnode lock exclusively to change it and shared to
 * read it.
