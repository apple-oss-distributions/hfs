 * hfs_getnewvnode - get new default vnode
 *
 * The vnode is returned with an iocount and the cnode locked.
 * The cnode of the parent vnode 'dvp' may or may not be locked, depending on
 * the circumstances.   The cnode in question (if acquiring the resource fork),
 * may also already be locked at the time we enter this function.
 *
 * Note that there are both input and output flag arguments to this function.
 * If one of the input flags (specifically, GNV_USE_VP), is set, then
 * hfs_getnewvnode will use the parameter *vpp, which is traditionally only
 * an output parameter, as both an input and output parameter.  It will use
 * the vnode provided in the output, and pass it to vnode_create with the
 * proper flavor so that a new vnode is _NOT_ created on our behalf when
 * we dispatch to VFS.  This may be important in various HFS vnode creation
 * routines, such a create or get-resource-fork, because we risk deadlock if
 * jetsam is involved.
 *
 * Deadlock potential exists if jetsam is synchronously invoked while we are waiting
 * for a vnode to be recycled in order to give it the identity we want.  If jetsam
 * happens to target a process for termination that is blocked in-kernel, waiting to
 * acquire the cnode lock on our parent 'dvp', while our current thread has it locked,
 * neither side will make forward progress and the watchdog timer will eventually fire.
 * To prevent this, a caller of hfs_getnewvnode may choose to proactively force
 * any necessary vnode reclamation/recycling while it is not holding any locks and
 * thus not prone to deadlock.  If this is the case, GNV_USE_VP will be set and
 * the parameter will be used as described above.
 *
 *  !!! <NOTE> !!!!
 * In circumstances when GNV_USE_VP is set, this function _MUST_ clean up and either consume
 * or dispose of the provided vnode. We funnel all errors to a single return value so that
 * if provided_vp is still non-NULL, then we will dispose of the vnode. This will occur in
 * all error cases of this function --  anywhere we zero/NULL out the *vpp parameter. It may
 * also occur if the current thread raced with another to create the same vnode, and we
 * find the entry already present in the cnode hash.
 * !!! </NOTE> !!!

 * releasing the blocks from an open-unlinked file when all references to it have dropped,
 * and handling resource forks separately from data forks.
 *
 * Note that we take only the vnode as an argument here (rather than the cnode).
 * Recall that each cnode supports two forks (rsrc/data), and we can always get the right
 * cnode from either of the vnodes, but the reverse is not true -- we can't determine which
 * vnode we need to reclaim if only the cnode is supplied.
 *
 * This function is idempotent and safe to call from both hfs_vnop_inactive and hfs_vnop_reclaim
 * if both are invoked right after the other.  In the second call, most of this function's if()
 * conditions will fail, since they apply generally to cnodes still marked with C_DELETED.
 * As a quick check to see if this function is necessary, determine if the cnode is already
 * marked C_NOEXISTS.  If it is, then it is safe to skip this function.  The only tasks that
 * remain for cnodes marked in such a fashion is to teardown their fork references and
 * release all directory hints and hardlink origins.  However, both of those are done
 * in hfs_vnop_reclaim.  hfs_update, by definition, is not necessary if the cnode's catalog
 * entry is no longer there.
 *
 * 'reclaim' argument specifies whether or not we were called from hfs_vnop_reclaim.  If we are
 * invoked from hfs_vnop_reclaim, we can not call functions that cluster_push since the UBC info
 * is totally gone by that point.
